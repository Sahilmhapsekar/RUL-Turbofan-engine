# Turbofan Engine Remaining Useful Life Prediction

This project aims to predict the **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** of turbofan engines using sensor data collected over multiple operational cycles. By analyzing time-series sensor readings, the goal is to estimate how many cycles remain before engine failure.

## Project Summary

- Performed **data preprocessing and cleaning** to handle missing and noisy values  
- Conducted **feature engineering** to extract key parameters affecting engine health  
- Developed a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model for RUL prediction  
- Evaluated model performance using **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)** for each engine  

## Tools and Technologies
Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
